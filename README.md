## minishell

my own little shell mimicking bash

- builtin functions(echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit etc...)
- ; seperates commands 
- ' and " work like in bash except for multiline commands
- redirections \>, \>>, \< work like in bash
- pipes | work like in bash
- environment variables($sth) work like in bash
- $? works like in bash
- ctrl-C, ctrl-D, ctrl-\ have same results as in bas

### 

## how to run minishell
